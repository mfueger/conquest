# Conquest

Ascii game ported from the Amiga version by Bob Shimbo (1992).

I have many fond memories from the days of the Commodore Amiga. Besides sporting many great graphic games, a few text-based games were also worth playing. Among them, one of my favorites was Conquest. This is the Ruby port.

See **instructions.txt** for the original notes included with the game.

## Starting the game

	ruby conquest.rb

The original source code can be found in **Conquest-source.lha**

(requires ruby 1.9.2+)
